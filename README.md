# Rock Paper Scissors 

This is a basic Rock Paper Scissors game built as my first project!  
It's a simple implementation where a player can play against the computer.

## How It Works

- The player selects either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
- The winner is determined based on the classic rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Scissors beats Paper
  - Paper beats Rock

##  Features
- Random computer move
- Winner detection logic
- Score tracking

## Technologies Used
- HTML / CSS (for UI)  
- JavaScript (for game logic)

> This is a beginner-level project created to practice JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

Future Improvements:
-Add score tracking
-Add animations or sound effects
-Improve UI design
-Make it mobile responsive
-Add multiplayer option

Let me know if you'd like to adjust this for:
- a command-line version (no HTML/CSS)
- or add things like GitHub Pages live demo link.
